Polldaddy Voting Exploit
This is a simple php proof-of-concept that demonstrates how to vote on the Polldaddy
stars rating system. This proof-of-concept is provided without any warranty, and
I do not take responsibility for the actions of any user. This is designed only to
demonstrate the vulnerabilities in the Polldaddy voting system, and not intended
to be used for nefarious purposes, or anything in violation of any laws or the
Polldaddy.com Terms of Service.

This bot allows a user to put in an array of proxies, and allows the bot to cast
one vote per proxy in the list per execution. This could be put into a loop with
a delay in order to increase voting. I am not sure what the Polldaddy timeout is
although other sources seem to indicate about 6 seconds at this time.
